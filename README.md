# Reusable React Components

### Project Description

The project involves replicating a provided design for a web application using React. The design will serve as a visual reference and includes various components, layouts, and styling specifications.

**Key Project Objectives:**

1. Component Creation: 
The candidate should create React components that mirror the elements and structure of the provided design. This includes headers, footers, navigation bars, content sections, and any other UI elements present in the design.

2. Props Usage: 
The candidate should use props to pass data and customize components as needed. For example, dynamic content, such as text or images, should be passed as props to components.

3. Styling with CSS/SASS/SCSS: 
The project should make use of CSS/SASS/SCSS to apply styles to components. 

4. Responsive Design: 
The web application should be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations. Media queries and CSS flexbox/grid layouts may be used to achieve responsiveness.

5. Component Composition: 
The candidate should demonstrate an understanding of component composition by breaking down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components. This enhances code readability and maintainability.
